<p>Pretty early in my life I decided I wanted to be an engineer. A little bit later
I discovered writing software can be really fun and I ejoyed it. Then I found
out it pays really well. But I always asked myself is that enough to be happy?
What does it mean to be happy anyway? On faculty I saw a lot of people that got
into CS because "it pays well". I mean, that's ok, programming is a job like any
other else. I never got into it because of these reasons.</p>
