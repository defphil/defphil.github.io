    <article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
       <p>It's been quite some time since I wrote Clojure, probably around 2 months or
so. I stumbled upon <a href="http://ecmendenhall.github.io/blog/blog/2013/09/05/clean-clojure-functions/" title="&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this</span></a> blogpost by Connor Mendenhall. Reading it carefully
without skimming is really recommended, and fun. It inspired me enough to write
my first blogpost in 2019.</p>

<p>My first introduction to functional programming was through Scheme and SICP (I
am re-reading this book for few years now, it never stops to amaze me). This
would be the core concept that would slap me from the back of the head when I
started getting my feet wet with Clojure. Whole process of writing code
alongside REPL, coming back to it, reiterating it, making it more idiomatic,
achieving more with much less code that is more readable,  all of those things
are core concepts of SICP, which I didn't get on my first tries. Going through
book again felt very rewarding and made my efforts in functional programming
that more rewarding .</p>

<p>In this blogpost we can see usual way of writing functional code. 
Immutable data + small and clean (not always pure) functions, and
whole process of achieving that through some weird but natural way of splitting
things apart while working alongside REPL. Yeah, a lot of concepts in one sentence,
but that's all there is to it, and it is really simple when you get what each of
those concepts mean and what they stand for.</p>

<p>I consider every functional language to be kind of a different beast. Core
concepts are the same, and if you get that, big chances are you will peak on the
other side of some other interesting and exotic language (and if you are reading
this blogpost I am sure you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> kind of person to begin with). Haskell is
notorious by it's type system, Common Lisp by it's flexibility of writing
imperative/functional code and it's meta-programming capabilities, Erlang about
it's concurrency, and Clojure? Clojure is data oriented language. And it blew my
mind! It totally changed the way how I perceive abstractions and write code.</p>

<p>How Clojure achieves that special layer of abstraction between underlying data
and clean Lisp-like syntax is through literals and core concepts like
immutability. After enough staring at different parentheses, letters and
symbols, you get the sense of what is what, and what fits where. 
And then everything snaps right in front of your eyes. 
It feels like you almost see the data flowing through code. By carefully
writing small decoupled functions (again, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read the blogpost which represents
very nicely how code evolves from something big and clunky, to something very
idiomatic, easy to maintain and read</span>), top to bottom, breaking problems into
very small pieces. And how you move down the buffer of your favourite text
editor (<em>:cough:</em> Emacs <em>:cough:</em>) you see those small and nice functions that do
only one thing combined with each other, on top of immutable data, state of your
data becomes much clearer, you get the sense about what is happening in your own
program. The whole process of reiterating through code, making it more how
Clojure code is meant to be simply rewards you with clean and robust end
result. You can see on Github a bunch of libraries that haven't been touched for
years, but don't let that fool you, they aren't dead, they just don't need to be
touched. They work how they should, people are using them and don't think about
them anymore. Only language where I've seen this is the same case is Common
Lisp, maybe even more fascinating in that regard than Clojure, but that's for
different topic.</p>

<p>Now things aren't that fine and dandy in the beginning. I had a luck that I
was exposed to Emacs much earlier than I began working with Clojure. I can't
imagine writing Clojure (and any other functional or REPL-based language) in
any other environment (Cursive is great, go check it out, but I use IntelliJ 
only for Java). But my main hurdle with Clojure was <em>way of doing things right</em>. I
still consider myself an amateur Clojurist, I don't have any real world
full-time job experience with Clojure, but in the beginning I felt really
overwhelmed. I was overthinking my every step, and was getting confused by
possibility of doing one thing on N different ways.</p>

<p><em>Should I use multidimensional
vector, or map? How do I achieve X-thing without iterating through whole set?
Should I rewrite this big function using multimethods or separate them completely?</em></p>

<p><strong>Getting Clojure</strong> by <a href="http://russolsen.com" title="Russ Olsen">Russ Olsen</a> helped me tremendously with all those questions
 that made me rethink my every step. And solution for this kind of problem was
 very simple as always... write. more. Clojure. code. With all that out of the
 way, I had my favourite language. When I had to do some work in Java, or C I
 was always thinking about how elegant and how pragmatic whole Clojure landscape is. I want it to be adopted more, language itself is very
 opinionated and that could be problem to a wider adoption, but after that
 initial period of struggling with a lot of new concepts I appreciated every bit
 about it. And I've met a lot of people doing really cool stuff with
 Clojure. Like for example mind-bending stuff from <a href="http://brutalism.rs" title="Vladimir Mitrovic">Vladimir Mitrovic</a>, or less
 artistic and more scientific efforts from <a href="https://dragan.rocks" title="Dragan Djuric">Dragan Djuric</a> and his work in Data
 Science/ML/High Performance Computing.</p>

<p>I can really see myself using Clojure just for sake of using it. Hobby project
here and there for now. But I would really like to make a living out of it when
I gain more experience as developer. Until then I will work hard to be better at
it.</p>

<p>Clojure and it's ecosystem feel modern, refreshing and sophisticated. As it grows more
mature and as guys from Cognitect put more efforts into tooling and ecosystem it
is really starting to represent something that we lost along the way of
technological advancement and industrialization of software and
programming.</p>
