<main>
<p>I've ordered a copy of the book by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols <em>'The Rust Programming Language'</em>. I was following development of Rust for last two years, reading various blogs and posts by it's community members, and decided that this is the year when I will get my feet wet in Rust. Before this I was writing fair amount of C, and was familiar with programming in C++ and Assembly. As I was EE major I was exposed to various lower levels of logic and programming and I liked it. 3 Summers ago I started playing with Scheme and around that time I was bending my mind around Functional programming concepts. After fair amount of Emacs hacking, writing Racket and Scheme, thanks to the one of my professors I got into Clojure. So you can see why I was always more or less expecting to learn Rust sooner than later. I was waiting for well written book and solid friendly community to be deciding factors for my soon to be realized time investment.</p>

<p>But as things never work out as they are planned, my copy of the book is taking much longer than it should. Her delivery is delayed and I am going on vacation without my laptop tomorrow. I had few days free before going to the seaside, and I really needed to scratch that itch that Rust provoked. And it's funny how universe aligns things, just few days ago I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/crazymykl/rust-koans" title="Rust koans">Rust koans</a>. Already familiar way of learning and exercising, patented by Ruby programmers, where you correct tests and make them work. Also whole method of learning was similar to reading <em>'Little Schemer'</em> fairly popular book among fellow Lispers. So I'll use this blog post to summarize few early impressions about Rust, and let me tell you straight away, I am loving it so far!</p>

<h2 id="from-arch-enemy-to-best-friend-compiler">From arch enemy to best friend -- compiler</h2>

<p>Usually when you write some chunk of code in X amount of time, and you hit compile, in those few seconds while it's taking you to see the results on screen your heart is hoping it won't see some nasty error messages. If that happens you will start facepalming or banging head against the desk. With Rust story is a little different. <strong>I feel like compiler is teaching me the most about how to program in Rust</strong>. It literally feels like having some more experienced friend/college/teacher above your shoulder that taps you on the back and points you in the right direction. I am learning, Rust is <em>different</em> than most programming languages I've encountered so far, and its normal that I'll be chasing my own tail for some time. But compiler with it's nice error messages actually reduces that time by significant margin. Let me give you a short example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    change(&amp;s);
}

fn change(some_string: &amp;String) {
    some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust variables are immutable unless you state otherwise by putting `mut` before variable. But references are immutable too by default. So here we are passing string as a reference to a function change. And look how nicely Rust's compiler explains that to us.</p>

<pre><code>error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*some_string` as mutable
 --&gt; test.rs:8:5
  |
7 | fn change(some_string: &amp;String) {
  |                        ------- use `&amp;mut String` here to make mutable
8 |     some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
</code></pre>

<p>Now combine this cool messages with whole concept of running test seamlessly inside Emacs, I edit the code in left split, and see the tests and results in right split. Amazing way to learn if you ask me. Sometimes I get stuck, I don't understand what I need to do in specific test, I first study the error message, if I still can't find out what's the problem I search Rust's excellent documentation. It is very well written, with simple examples that very well explain how are things supposed to work. I am really blown away how whole experience is guided in right direction.</p>

<h2 id="thing-i-disliked-the-most-about-clojure">Thing I disliked the most about Clojure</h2>

<p>My biggest gripe about Clojure is infinite ways of doing things. Now I get it, I am noob, learning a lot, hacking my way through many things, young, inexperienced, hot headed, I understand all objective criticism that could come my way. But I always feel overwhelmed while writing Clojure. I liked Lisps much more because it offered less possibilities to do things, but it was still enough to do basically everything. Clojure got that JVM-ness, endless possibilities, and I found that to be source of some sort of anxiety while writing it. Which is pity since language is so nice and data oriented. I guess I just need to spend more time with it, learn more, and things will settle down somewhere in my brain. Now there was that ancient debate between Clojure/Lisp programmers and Haskellers. Totally different paradigms and ways of thinking/writing code. Nothing can beat Haskell in terms of strictness. It's pure, it's static, in the end if it compiles it's right, it works. Well, I guess I've never written a lot of Haskell. But Rust is somewhere along those lines. But it is much more polite, much more friendly. And not in some empiric deterministic way. It just feels much more friendly. I feel more relaxed writing it, I am leaning on compiler to help me out if I get something wrong, or make some stupid mistake or misconception. Now I get it that you need to know exactly what you are doing or intending to do, but that's on some much more proficient level than the one that I am on currently.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>There is some warmth and fuzziness that Rust provided that I didn't expect at all. It's beautiful, I am having a blast learning about it and writing the code. Can't wait for me to return from vacation and start reading the book. I am waiting for <em>'Getting Clojure'</em> by Russ Olsen to arrive too, so I will have pretty busy August and September. :) You can expect further impressions/experiences here, I am eager to write them down and share them with you. It feels so nice to be using modern technologies. I appreciate UNIX and C, and all that C++ is (or better to say was) written for a reason, but I really wish more people approached new technologies with open mind. We could all profit from using modern tools, make our code more safe, expressive and keep developers entertained, productive and happy. :)</p>
