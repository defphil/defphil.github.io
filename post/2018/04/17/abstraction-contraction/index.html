<h2 id="software-and-it-s-weird-nature">Software and it's weird nature</h2>

<p>The most exciting and weird thing I found out about in early teenage days was software. I started my journey with TurboPASCAL on start of my second year of high school. It felt really weird at first, mostly because I kinda expected from computers to be magicaly less stupid than they actualy were. "What? I have to tell them when I am about to use natural number, wtf?" was just one of the thoughts that were flashing through my head at the time. Now that sentence just puts smirk on my face, but back in the days it was popping into my mind for quite some time.</p>

<p>Programming was really weird for me. It was such an empiric, strict and specific thing, that had lots in common with mathematics, yet it's results were so abstract but immidietely applicable (contrary to math, where result can take you quite some time to put it into good use). The more I played with different programming languages the more I get the sense that the core is the same for every language/tool. Ways of producing and translating specific things into code were starting to be more simillar and simillar every time I was creating something new. Actualy what was going on was that I started to notice patterns, gain (extremely small but still relevant) experience and started to develop sense for the code and abstraction behind it. I finaly started to see how data flows, changes (sadly), creates states and interact with inner and outer parts. It's probably the biggest reward that I got since started programming.</p>

<h2 id="lambda-bomb">Lambda bomb</h2>

<p>And then inevitable happened. I stumbled upon functional programming. Considering my curiosity and ADHD, I knew it would be too much for me too resist. I was briefly introduced to Scheme and functional paradigm back in the high school, which I can leave for separate blog post since I remember that moment very vividly. Emacs felt like natural environment for me, I wasn't scared of it since I had few years of Vim under my belt. Reading SICP and Little Schemer felt so refreshing. It provoked the similar mystique like learning for the first time that computer doesn't know when I am using character or a number. But then some kind of rewiring started to happen in my brain. I started to look at the code differently. Situatuion where the change of how my brain percieves code was the most evident was when teaching programming to beginners. My sister started programming as part of the course on faculty around that time. She wasn't so much into it, it was more as a side thing for her. I was helping her with homework and tasks when she got stuck. And I was amazed how much of here thoughts I recognized and remembered. Everything kinda triggered my mind to suddenly remember how it felt 7 years back when I wrote my first programs. That delta from starting moment to current where I was at the time when I realized this was so inspiring and made me feel so good.</p>

<p>I got into Clojure and started to read (more read than write sadly) and write a lot of Clojure code. During that time I was doing some Java stuff for faculty, and only Clojure in my free time that I've spent programming. It grabbed me for 6 months, during which I didn't look at other languages and technologies which was a real miracle considering my unconsisting and distractive nature. What was next to happened really blow my expectations away. After those 6 months my mind was rewiring to many new and lean concepts that Clojure provided. And since I wasn't looking into any other stuff I didn't notice that.</p>

<h2 id="realizations">Realizations</h2>

<p>During this semester I am having Algorithms and Data Structures course (I was studying EE for few years before moving to current faculty where I am studying Information Systems & Technologies just to clarify that I had reasonable experience going into this course). I looked back at all the things from totaly different perspective. Clojure changed me. I was forced to use Java and API professors provided, and oh boy what a drag. I suddenly realized how more intuitive and smarter Clojure is. It can be really elegant yet powerful. But what was totally beyond me is how far that point is from beginners perspective. Those <strong>rewires</strong> I was talking about took me significant amount of work and learning to achieve. But everything was mostly because I was used to think about programming in procedural way. C and Pascal made me think into certain way and it was hard to not think in `while` and `for` loops. End result was amazing but It was really easy to get there. Which is pitty, since I think it's superior way for getting feel for software as an abstract not as an process of writing some code. Most imporantly this progress cured me of some really wierd thing that was going on my nerves. During my early days since I dabbled into programming, I always had a feeling other people around me talking about software were talking too abstract. To me it seemed irritating and weird, as I was always thinking too much about implementation, often overthinking simple things. I always had that weird feeling people were talking from distant point of view about the software. But now, when I think of my process of thought and how I communicate my ideas and thoughts to the others I am doing the same. I don't feel like wrestling with languages and computers, and feel more like using them.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Most importantly I developed some kind of sense for code. For example I am writing some method in Java, and when it starts to feel like I am rewriting 80% of some other method I wrote 3 months ago I stop to rethink and see if I can do it differently if possible elegantly. It feels good, motivates me to learn more. I can't say I enjoyed programming in the beginning the same as I do now.</p>
