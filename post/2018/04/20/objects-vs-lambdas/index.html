<h2 id="change-of-perception">Change of perception</h2>

<p>This won't be another "Oh my god, SICP changed my life and the way I look at software" blog post. Although it did certainly have significant impact on my perception on how to write software, but I want to talk about something a little bit different today; how functional programming changed the way I write Object Oriented code.</p>

<p>It's rather easy to get caught up in pitfalls of object oriented programming. Modeling and defining problems to fit into OOP layouts and shapes is not an easy task. My early high school Java experiences were just like that. What should be private, what should be public? Should I implement this as an abstract class and go from that, or should I use getters and setters to manipulate instances as I needed them. So many things, it was a bit overwhelming. But over time I got the sense for it. Some things you just don't do, some are logical to separate, etc etc... But then other thing became bigger problem. Abstraction. Dealing with my first >1K LOC project in Java, and things started to crumble. That's when I first touched design patterns. But after that came along refactoring and maintenance. Which again felt cumbersome.</p>

<h2 id="functions-all-the-way">Functions all the way</h2>

<p>After writing and reading more and more functional code, I started to appreciate expressiveness of functional languages. Many of things for which FP languages were well known for seemed like magic. I was talking about some Clojure functions with one of my professors on faculty and every few minutes I would with cautious voice ask "I... I can do that?". Less code is always better. Immutability, no side effects, using functions as first class citizens, everything was coming along. It was hard to wrap my head around weird syntax and totally different way of reading and thinking about code, but I made enough progress to keep me interested.</p>

<p>I was reading and writing Clojure and Scheme for few months without touching any other languages. When I opened my old Java project I suddenly realized how messy everything was. Then I found out Quora post from Alan Kay <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-functional-programming-seen-as-the-opposite-of-OOP-rather-than-an-addition-to-it" title="in which">in which</a> he described his point of view and history behind differences of these two major paradigms. I left with one conclusion from all this reading and thinking. Object orientation is much more about organization that it is about strict trying to reduce problem to exact model that OOP requires. For example, let's say you are doing some big project in Java or C#. You want to name and organize things in a way that when you are on some totally different place in code base, you can hold good part of model in your head. It is also important to recognize and have awareness about states and all the links between your objects. That's why careful and well thought use of inheritance is important. And since many of object oriented languages got good part of "fancy" functional things, you can to certain extent write more expressiveness and less code. Functional programming helped me be a better at Object Oriented programming.</p>

<p>Place where I noticed changes the most in my style of writing OO code was oddly enough Python. I used Python as scripting language 90% of the time. Writing functions/procedures, then glueing everything together in main file/function. But lately I have started to organize and structure code more thoughtfully. I was always scared of object orientation in Python since things used to get messy pretty fast. As of now, I think I can say that is not the case.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>But anyway I am sure you can get better at anything just by doing it more. It was just mildly interesting how functional programming changed my object oriented programming. I encourage everyone to give FP a shot, I found it really fun, especially if you are more into math, and let's not fool ourselves kids, math is important! Now I see so many JS devs writing some stuff without even remotely understanding logic and reasoning behind the code they are writing. That's especially noticeable in JS community since many people just drop them selves into that mess of technological advancement that emerged during last 10 years. They are writing some spaghetti code, a lot of nested for and while loops, if conditions all over the place, inside which they are calling some other functions. And your brain just explodes when you try to decompose that kind of code. And worse of all, you could achieve same (or even better) result with 4 lines of code using .map(), .reduce() and .filter()...</p>

<p>Also I see people writing object oriented code without knowing basics of OOP. You need to make basic terms and practices of OOP straight in your head, totally straight, so that you know what you are talking/thinking about even if someone wakes you up at 3AM... Few days ago I was sitting in local cafe doing some work, and I couldn't unhear the talk of two PHP devs on the other side of the table. They got tangled up in OO hell. I wanted to help them even though I don't know PHP, and I came to conclusion that they didn't know how to explain me clear difference and use cases between abstract class and object interface. You ain't going nowhere with bad foundations.</p>

<p>I learned in similar manner, that all my hurdles in the beginning with object oriented programming were caused by not understanding every small detail of basics. After a lot of bashing head against the wall things eventually got into my head and things made much more sense.</p>
