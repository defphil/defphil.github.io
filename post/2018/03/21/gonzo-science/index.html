<h2 id="seeing-the-white-rabbit">Seeing the white rabbit</h2>

<p>Yesterday I've finished reading <strong>What the Dormouse Said</strong> and <strong>The Soul of a New Machine</strong>. First I have to make a confession. I always had weak spot for 60s in America. It is such distant place for me, both geographically and by time, but it always impressed me and inspired me, don't know why. I was hooked up on Rock 'n' Roll when I was a kid, it was influence from my uncle. Remember watching that Woodstock concert from '69 countless times. There was something very interesting about those people in that video, but at that time what I probably didn't realize was that they were all stoned as hell.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was always seeing recommendations to read What the Dormouse Said, both on Reddit and Hacker News. I skimmed the short description on Amazon and I knew that I will like this book. So I kept it for special occasion. Wanted to read it and enjoy it. So this week I caught some heavy flu, so I used the extra free time to start reading the book. Little did I know that I will read the whole thing in a breath.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>What got me with this book right from the start were people and relatively small community in which they lived at certain point in time. San Francisco, Palo Alto, northwest corner of Santa Clara. Place where all those weird, smart, young people influenced each other without even having a notion about it. Politics, activism, antiwar movements, engineers, physicists and mathematicians, all of them in the end worked together and created something that changed the world permanently. Looking from today's standpoint to me everything seems like some crazy movie. How much these people achieved with so little is really inspiring and demoralizing at the same time! What left the biggest impression on me personally is their way of thinking and not accepting what was served to them as reality. They were hungry for more and they had urge to achieve it. I was always freak for history of technology and people behind it, but I could find too much information about people from that period, besides few interviews and youtube clips and this book I mentioned above.</p>

<p>They were hackers in true sense of that word. They weren't hacking just algorithms and machines, they were hacking way of living. Let me illustrate this. It's 2018. most liberal the earth has ever been, supposedly. Now imagine Elon Musk smoking weed and popping LSD in his lab, and he's open about it. Pretty shocking right!? But these people back in the day did that, and in a such sophisticated manner it helped them create something different, machine of tomorrow for the yesterday's world.</p>

<h2 id="west-coast-s-cradle-of-ai-stanford">West coast's cradle of AI - Stanford</h2>

<p>Back in the day many of the fresh graduates, PhDs and smart dropouts in mathematics and physics could only go to universities and work on some government/military financed project. Startup was non-existing word in English language back in the day. But few people had the vision of machines working in favor of humans, harnessing the power and abstracting physics and nature in such way that it could be represented and controlled by mathematical model. <strong>Doug Engelbart</strong> was one of those. He had an idea to augment computers (AI) into human's way of living. <strong>John McCarthy</strong> brilliant mathematician who will become pioneer of mathematical logic in artificial intelligence. Many, many more were involved, but all were gravitating around SRI (Stanford Research Institute) and SAIL (Stanford 
Artificial Intelligence Lab). Other side of community that wasn't related directly to tech consisted of many Psychology PhDs and scientists, activists and writers. Their mutual interest of changing and exploring limits of human's perception was the bonding thread that brought them together on gatherings and rituals at their homes.</p>

<p>In span of 10-15 years these people created foundations of modern computing, internet and networking, handheld devices, communications and information processing and flowing. They were just so much ahead of their time that they were destined to fail. But next generation of brilliant minds that was sitting right there in SAIL and SRI labs at very young age was ready to pick up where they stopped and refine those idea's making next big push into territory of micro computers, that will set further foundations for personal computers revolution during late 70s/early 80s. <strong>Xerox PARC</strong> is very well known name. They will be crucial link and medium for channeling ideas that pioneers and professors before them started in Stanford's labs.</p>

<h3 id="picking-all-the-pieces-on-youtube">Picking all the pieces on YouTube</h3>

<p>After I finished reading the first book, I went to YouTube and watched for the first time whole thing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY" title="The Mother of all Demos">The Mother of all Demos</a>. Now I was seeing everything I read about. While reading I thought my mind couldn't be blown up any more than it was currently, but boy was I wrong. Watching something like this, imagining it happening in 60s, when my grandparents just got black and white television at that time, was really experience. It made me think why are we not achieving something similar today, with all that processing power what are the boundaries? Do we need new and fresh set of mind, new way of thinking and looking at things? But I will leave these for another blog post.</p>

<p>After that I was reading more about Xerox and Alan Kay and co. Then what I found interesting on YouTube is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YupOC_6bfMI&amp;list=PL-_93BVApb58I3ZV67LW3S_JEMFnDrQDj" title="Xerox Alto Restoration series">Xerox Alto Restoration series</a>, which I read about few years ago on <a href="http://www.righto.com" title="Ken Shirriff's blog">Ken Shirriff's blog</a>, you'll be seeing him a lot in these videos anyway.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I think it would be appropriate to wrap up. This blog post is my first one, so it is not making some specific point. It's rather setting a foundation and scene for what's to come. Computers and programming were always about <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>learning</strong>. What you can expect is series of technical posts where I will write about experiences that I have while learning and working on things, while in parallel I will try to write about something more abstract and as I like to call them more <strong>meta</strong> posts about computing, talking about people and their motivations and ideas behind some interesting topics in computing. Until next one.</p>
