      <description>Learning struggles Today, on my way home I was listening to CaSE podcast, who&#39;s guest was none other than Rich Hickey. For the biggest part of podcast he was talking about some really cool technological things that we can expect in near future in Clojure ecosystem. I recommend anyone familiar with Clojure or ClojureScript to listen to this episode, I always like hearing Rich talk. But the meatiest part that got me thinking was near the end, probably last twenty minutes of this episode.</description>

      <description>Seeing the white rabbit Yesterday I&#39;ve finished reading What the Dormouse Said and The Soul of a New Machine. First I have to make a confession. I always had weak spot for 60s in America. It is such distant place for me, both geographically and by time, but it always impressed me and inspired me, don&#39;t know why. I was hooked up on Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll when I was a kid, it was influence from my uncle.</description>
