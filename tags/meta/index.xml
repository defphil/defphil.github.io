      <description>With this post, I wanted to recap what changes I&#39;ve introduced to my digital life, on and offline. In general, I removed and deleted most of things. Went back to open source software, standardized formats that work everywhere(txt), reduced my iPhone usage... So lets start:
 I deleted Facebook. (Which I had from 2007. to 2012. and from 2015. until this moment)   I deleted Instagram. I realized I was not looking at the content I wanted and followed, but Facebook was serving me too much ads and content I really didn&#39;t care about, so I found out there was no point in having it.</description>
