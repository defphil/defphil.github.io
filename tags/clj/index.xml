      <description>It’s been quite some time since I wrote Clojure, probably around 2 months or so. I stumbled upon this blogpost by Connor Mendenhall. Reading it carefully without skimming is really recommended, and fun. It inspired me enough to write my first blogpost in 2019.
My first introduction to functional programming was through Scheme and SICP (I am re-reading this book for few years now, it never stops to amaze me). This would be the core concept that would slap me from the back of the head when I started getting my feet wet with Clojure.</description>
