	  <h1>Hacker manifesto</h1>


<blockquote>
<p>
A manifesto is a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government. A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or public consensus or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is artistic or political in nature, but may present an individual's life stance.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quote from wikipedia about what manifesto is. When people usually ask me
what I do besides looking at black screen and white text, I tell them with
slight notion of discomfort that I am a hacker. Now the next thing that happens
is either they laugh or they make a weird face expressions. When you tell people
that you are hacker first thing that falls to their mind is that you are hacking
some 3 letter agency's servers, or robbing a bank just by typing some weird
letters into computer. Stay with me for the rest of the writing and allow me to
explain.</p>

<h2 id="interaction-between-human-and-machine">Interaction between human and machine</h2>

<p>How are we defining our interactions with machines? Are we the ones that are in
control? Or we stay in chains of our own minds and projections? I think machines
are there to help us get out of our own shackles. Many will think and judge
technology as something that has impacted humans negatively during recent years
and expansion on Web 2.0, but I will always strongly disagree. Every thought
about this matter usually boils down to one of two very famous perspectives:
Are machines having embedded, almost symbiotic nature, where they present
extension of body or idea. Or they are waiting for further advancement where
they overtake and replace. Now, talking to people about these two distinct ideas
is like asking someone if God exists. Your milage may vary, but I stopped asking
people to choose one of those two. But I was always speaking from personal
experience. I consider myself as a very good and quiet observer. As a result of
many observetions and many more thought experiments I started to really believe
in first idea, that machine presents extension of human thought process,
therefor it makes impact on something in real life, and the circle closes where
that action-reaction cycle gets us back to us, humans, but on totally opposite
spectrum than from one from which we started. In the beginning we were the only
ones, creators, but in the end we are consumers, recievers.</p>

<p>Technology moved us, changed us, shaped us, we got dependent on her, but we are
the creators. It is such beautiful relationship, rather than addiction. Humans
as a most advanced species are carrying heavy burden. When I think of human
being I cannot but not think of them as echo chambers. Now there are the ones
who have defeated or are carrying this burden successfuly, but most are weak and
subjected to mentioned effect. And technology is amplifying the state that is
nothing but 1:1 copy of state inside the chamber (read human being). Fast and
accessible data communication between different end points made it really simple
and obvious for casual observer to notice chaotic nature of human's inner
mechanisms and advents.</p>
