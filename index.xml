      <description>Change of perception after going functional route This won&#39;t be another &#34;Oh my god, SICP changed my life and the way I look at software&#34; blog post. Although it did certainly have significant impact on my perception on how to write software, I want to talk about something a little bit different today. And that is how I started thinking about Object Oriented Programming from different point of view than before I got my feet wet with functional paradigm.</description>

      <description>Software and it&#39;s weird nature The most exciting and weird thing I found out about in early teenage days was software. I started my journey with TurboPASCAL on start of my second year of high school. It felt really weird at first, mostly because I kinda expected from computers to be magicaly less stupid than they actualy were. &#34;What? I have to tell them when I am about to use natural number, wtf?</description>

      <description>Seeing the white rabbit Yesterday I&#39;ve finished reading What the Dormouse Said and The Soul of a New Machine. First I have to make a confession. I always had weak spot for 60s in America. It is such distant place for me, both geographically and by time, but it always impressed me and inspired me, don&#39;t know why. I was hooked up on Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll when I was a kid, it was influence from my uncle.</description>

      <description># Code &amp;amp; Math I first started programming in early days of high school. My father is electrical engineer, so I was exposed to computers and electronics since age of three. He brought me some books about programming in Pascal. Previous to that I was mostly playing with Linux, configuring it, writing some scripts and modding games. I didnâ€™t have a feeling of actually writing software until that point. Near the end of high school I attended Computer Science courses in International Science Center Petnica.</description>
