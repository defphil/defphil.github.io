	<div class="post-content"><p>With this post, I wanted to recap what changes I’ve introduced to my digital
life, on and offline. In general, I removed and deleted most of things. Went
back to open source software, standardized formats that work everywhere(txt),
reduced my iPhone usage… So lets start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I deleted Facebook. (Which I had from 2007. to 2012. and from 2015. until this
moment)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deleted Instagram. I realized I was not looking at the content I wanted and
followed, but Facebook was serving me too much ads and content I really didn’t
care about, so I found out there was no point in having it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deleted Whatsapp. This will be related to next point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of my friends (like 80%) now have <code>Telegram</code>, which I’ve been using
from 2015. So I am really happy I have everyone covered with iMessage and
Telegram.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve deleted my main Twitter account and created empty one where I follow just
people that have something interesting to say (mostly developers that don’t
tweet about politics, so I use Twitter like some kind of RSS service)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve deleted a lot of websites from my elfeed feed in Emacs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moved all my notes to <code>org-mode</code>. This one is simple. I’ve already
been using vim and Emacs for almost 10 years now. Org is essentially plain
text, and nice iOS companion app <code>beorg</code> is providing me with sleek
overview ehen I do not have my MacBook with me (which is rare but still).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve deleted bunch of podcasts. I realized I was cluttering myself and
listening to a lot of shit that I used as background noise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduced my time on YouTube. No longer do I spend 3 hours watching some stupid
videos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Back to using pen and paper for brainstorming and sketching ideas. I found out
that this process feels much more natural for me. No need for fancy graphing
software and sketches, so I dropped omnigraffel for real thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve moved to <code>Firefox</code>. Now this is the tricky one. Chrome was not
an option. Despite being more performant I just cannot use Google’s browser
in 2019. Google is not what it used to be. And I get it. In the end it is all
a matter of choice. I don’t like the state in which web is today. Future of
internet is grim, and I decided to support open source, decentrilized web. Now
Mozilla is not a saint either, I do not like how they are forcing options and
adding stupid stuff into browser, but in the end I always manage to disable
things. Now the question is why I moved from Safari on macOS (since I still
use it on iPhone). DevTools. I find Safari unbearable when doing web
development. I just can’t stand it. Although I prefer Chrome the most in terms
of development tools, Firefox is tad different, but very usable &amp; powerful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ditched iTerm for <code>Terminal.app</code>. Since I started appreciating default vim
config with slight ajustments it just felt much smoother and responsive. I
hate input lag when I’m programming. Although iTerm2 is much better with new
renderer, something about Terminal.app feels really right (font rendering and
input latency I guess).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started using <code>Pinboard</code>. Oh god. If everything on the web could
be built this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am testdriving Drew DeVault’s <code>sourcehut</code> as a replacement for
Github. This is Pinboard of online git repo hosting. GitLab is slow with bad
UI/UX. Sourcehut implements Unix philosophy, it is open source and very
pragmatic and sturdy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m trying out <code>micro.blog</code>. I like the community so far. A lot of
mature and smart people. Every day I can read some interesting conversation. I
like it a lot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do once a week encrypted <code>TimeMachine</code> backups. Bought really
nice USB 3.1 SanDisk 128gb flash drive, using it as storage for music and backups.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think I will stop here. Last year or so was pretty cathartic in terms of how I
looked at services and the way I use computer everyday. Use open well
standardized formats, open source code is prefered. I found nice balance of
productivity which macOS provides and open source software (brew, emacs, vim,
git, mutt, firefox…) <em>Wake up people! We need to fight for open, transparent
and decentralized internet!</em> Start from your own machines and usages. Don’t give
away information to others so easily just because they offer you something for
free. Don’t be a product.</p>
