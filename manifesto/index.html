<h1 id="hacker-manifesto">Hacker manifesto</h1>

<pre><code>Or explanation of passionate computer nerd if you will
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>A manifesto is a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government. A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or public consensus or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is political or artistic in nature, but may present an individual&rsquo;s life stance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quote from wikipedia about what manifesto is. When people usually ask me what I do besides looking at black screen with white text, I tell them with slight notion of discomfort that I am a hacker. Now the next thing that happens is either they laugh or they make a weird face expression. When you tell people that you are hacker first thing that falls to their mind is that you are hacking some 3 letter agency&rsquo;s servers, or robbing a bank just by typing some weird letters on your computer. But usually that&rsquo;s not how it is, and the term <em>hacker</em> in my opinion is widely misused.</p>

<p>Hackers are having fun with computers. They are constantly exploring what is possible with the computer, as a machine that has discrete states, based on abstractions and mathematical proofs and models, giving (most of the time) expected results. Constantly learning about how these beasts of tightly packed integrated circuits and silicons that we carry in our pockets and backpacks work is what hackers do!
It took me going to faculty to see that there are people that are getting into the field just so they could find a job that pays well, which is absolutely fine. Not everyone needs to be hyper passionate to do something. I am sure some of those people are even better than me in writing code. But their perspective in terms of computers and art of programming is very different than mine (or someone who shares my opinion).
Which is again fine. We could start controversial topic under that name &lsquo;Not everyone can/should do programming&rdquo;, but I find that topic to be pretty pointless since you can&rsquo;t permit anyone what is he going to do with his life. That&rsquo;s why this topic that I am writing about here on this page is much more organic, since it relies on pure passion.</p>

<p>I sit in front of the computer for hours everyday. Maybe I am tweaking my Emacs config, writing some kernel module for Linux, or I am learning how to use illumos&rsquo; Zones since Docker sucks. But I do it without any intention to get something out of it except knowledge and fun. After I get up from computer I am thinking about how systems interact, I sit on a bus look at the people holding their phones and think about tremendous potential of pure (in this case still wasted) compute power, waiting to be harvested and used in so many amazing ways that will enhance our everyday lifes.</p>

<p>Hacker doesn&rsquo;t choose what to learn, because he tries to learn everything. His hunger for knowledge grows the more he knows. He doesn&rsquo;t do things for the grades, money or some other reward that is outside of realm of self-satisfaction produced by gaining knowledge and creating something awesome. You may say it&rsquo;s passion, or some other representation of finding yourself. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just pure curiosity of human intellect. In the end it doesn&rsquo;t matter. That self driving force that some people carry inside makes them do amazing things and help the world move forward. But all that doesn&rsquo;t come without cost. Pride and judgmental thinking towards others can be very often byproduct of a lot of hard work and ego.</p>
