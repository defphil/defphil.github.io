    I've been programming for little over 5 years now, and I've always been obsesed with how my terminals, editors, tiling WMs (ah, the Linux and *BSD days) and other stuff that you productively waste time on. Automate whole setup with multiple bash and Ansible scripts, so you crash your system and get everything up and runing with running single file. Yea, high school was blast! But as I got into faculty time became more and more precious. <a class="continue" rel="full-article" href="https://defphil.com/posts/syntax-highlighting-and-other-fluff/"> read more</a>

    I recently read Greg Hendershott's emacs themes blog post, and cribbed liberally from his approach to loading themes. I also cribbed his Hydra theme switcher. It was so fun to use! I wanted to try it with all the themes I have installed---but I didn't want to add all of them manually. Boo!
