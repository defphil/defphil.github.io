       			<p>Hi, my name is Filip Miletic.<br>
Best way to contact me is via email.<br>
Here you can take a look at my CV.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I am currently student at Faculty of Organisational Science -- Information
Systems and Technology, at University of Belgrade. Previously I've dropped out
of Electrical Engineering at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where I've
studied electronics and EE for 2 years.</p>

<p>I am mostly interested in lower level programming, but I am always learning
about everything I find interesting. So I've been learning about computers all
the way down how ICs and discrete circuits were made, all the way up to JS and
some web stuff. Although I didn't do much of web programming, I got some
experience behind my back.</p>

<p>Things that interest me the most in terms of Computer Science and Software
Engineering in general are low level programming (<strong>graphics and GPGPU, operating
systems</strong>), functional programming (<strong>lisp</strong>), and distributed systems (<strong>DevOps</strong>). I've
been doing some light game development but just for the sake of learning, since
I consider it great learning ground for integrating various different fields of
programming.</p>

<p>Currently I am mostly writing <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> (sometimes JAVA when I do projects for
faculty), <strong>Clojure</strong> (I've been learning it for some time, previously I've been
introduced to functional programming with Scheme), and <strong>Rust</strong>.</p>

<p>I am doing all my programming, writing and most of my reading in <strong>Emacs</strong>. I just
got so comfortable with the whole environment that I don't see myself changing
to anything else for the rest of my life. I've been using Vi for few years
before I switched to Emacs, since I am UNIX guy. Interest in operating systems
always kept me exploring various modern UNIX representations. My favourite
operating systems are <strong>SmartOS</strong> and <strong>OpenBSD</strong>. I use <strong>Linux</strong> only when I absolutely
have to, since I've found that those two systems I mentioned previously fit my
needs and tastes much better.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>On non-CS related stuff I enjoy reading and listening/playing music. I am DJ and
vinyl enthusiast. I love animals and hanging out in nature. When weather is nice
I enjoy skating.</p>
