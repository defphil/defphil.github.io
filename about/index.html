<h4 id="code-math"># Code &amp; Math</h4>

<p>I first started programming in early days of high school. My father is electrical engineer, so I was exposed to computers and electronics since age of three. He brought me some books about programming in Pascal. Previous to that I was mostly playing with Linux, configuring it, writing some scripts and modding games. I didn’t have a feeling of actually writing software until that point. Near the end of high school I attended Computer Science courses in International Science Center Petnica. I consider that to be the breaking point for me. During one of the evening lectures about history of programming languages and basic algorithms and data structures, I had that flashing moment in my head where something struck me, and I was like <em>“this is the thing I want to do”</em>.</p>

<p>I enrolled to Electrical Engineering. I was learning a lot of really interesting things related to computers on some fundamental level, like assembly, digital electronics and computer architecture. But in the end, after 2 years of wrestling with some other things I decided to drop out. I wasn’t satisfied and I always had the voice in my head telling me that this is not the thing I want to learn about and that I am missing out on some other things that would be much more appreciated and interesting for me personally, which are directly tied to writing software.</p>

<p>After a lot of thinking, I dropped out of EE course and went to the other faculty, enrolling into Information Systems and Technologies course. I wasn’t so sure about it, it had a lot of Economics and Finance in first two years, few Management, HR and Organizational subjects in every semester. But currently I am glad I made this choice. I am enjoying wide array of disciplines which in the end tie into Software Engineering much more than I initially thought.</p>

<p>Out of this turbulent education period (which is still not over, 2 years to go till the end) I found out what is the thing that I want to be best in. Learning. Always learn, read, think and tweak. I finally stopped comparing to anyone but myself from yesterday. I enjoy solving problems, even if they are not of technical nature. I took my time, did both math courses on both faculties and got really into mathematics and mathematical theory. I saw the opportunity to use that math knowledge in many other disciplines like probability and statistics, which where quite useful and even dare to say so needed in economics and finance.</p>

<p>I’ve spent few years in systems programming and operating systems programming (from my EE, that was the most “software” thing I could get there, and got relatively good at it). Around that time I started getting really in depth with UNIX and Linux. Learned and gained skills which I find really appealing even now when I moved further up the stack. DTrace and FreeBSD struck me the most. After which I got into illumos and whole thing that was left after Solaris apocalypse. Debugging in terminal, and system operations became few of the skills which I really value. I got really into lower level programming at that time, doing most of the things in C, bash, awk and grep.</p>

<p>Now I have to mention text editors which became some weird kind of hobby for me. First I was doing all my writing in Vim. I’ve managed to learn it without much hassle. Since high school and all those gentoo and arch reinstalls I found out vi to be the editor for me. But after 5 years of Vim, I installed <strong>Emacs</strong>. And it devoured everything from that point. Now I read my emails and RSS in it. Also what I found to be the topic that got my attention where mechanical keyboards. Huge amount of reading and money sunk into it. But I think I got to the end game with <strong>HHKB</strong>, on which I am currently typing this. :)</p>

<p><strong>Design, aesthetics and materials</strong> of things that surround me in everyday life are things that I pay attention to a lot. I was always developing sense for clean and simple. Found architecture really appealing, nice interiors and minimalistic looks also. Always found most inspiring people to be the ones that make blend of code and art. <em>Two things so abstract yet so different. One so precise and exact, and the other one so personal and subjective</em>. That&rsquo;s the reason I met some people that are now real source of inspiration, I went to the conferences and workshops which made me really fall in love with digital visualization, space mapping and generative design.</p>

<p>Thing that is essential for my life, that isn’t related to writing code and thinking about math, is <strong>music</strong>. I am hosting weekly <em>radio show</em> on local radio, playing mostly eclectic soul and hip hop music. I also collect and listen to <em>vinyl</em> records, and play them out loud over the weekends as <strong>DJ</strong>. I really get the kick out of it, keeps me at peace and focus with myself. That passion for music and whole timesink I put into it saved me few times from burnout on faculty and job. When I don’t code for homework or work, I code for fun.</p>
