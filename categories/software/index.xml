      <description>Software and it&#39;s weird nature The most exciting and weird thing I found out about in early teenage days was software. I started my journey with TurboPASCAL on start of my second year of high school. It felt really weird at first, mostly because I kinda expected from computers to be magicaly less stupid than they actualy were. &#34;What? I have to tell them when I am about to use natural number, wtf?</description>
